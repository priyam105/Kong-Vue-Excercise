## Kong Vue Excercise
The application is built using Vue 3 (compositions api), Typescript & Unit tests in Vitest. 

### Overview
The components are kept as loosely coupled as possible for reusability purpose.

The icons are copied from the figma as svg.

The default `max-width: 1366px;` set to `.service-catalog` is now added to `main` tag & modified to `max-width: 100vw;` for consistent look & feel on mac & windows.



### Additional Requirements 
- Added refresh button which gets displayed after every 10 second (added specifically to accomodate the requirement asked during Panel 1 interview).
- Debouncing
- Responsive
